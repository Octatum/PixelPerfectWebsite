        Using different techniques we create the illusion that an environment is
        larger than what was originally filmed, reducing on-set production costs
        and adding production value.

        We specialize on **Rotoscoping,** the art of animating masks on a
        timeline, isolating any elements so they can be individually used in
        further post production processes.

        With this technique we remove any unintended productions tools from a
        scene (such as wires, harnesses, microphones) or unwanted environment
        scenery (logos, ads, vehicles, etc.) to keep the final image flawless.

        Through this technique we create a digital replicate of a real-life
        camera movement, allowing us to add computer-generated elements during
        further stages in post-production.
