        Using different techniques we create the illusion that an environment is
        larger than what was originally filmed, reducing on-set production costs
        and adding production value.

        Creating computer generated imagery, such as 3D models, animations and

        Simulating elements such fire, smoke, water or even creating destruction

        We specialize on **Rotoscoping,** the art of animating masks on a
        timeline, isolating any elements so they can be individually used in
        further post production processes.

        With the help of our on-set VFX supervisors, we make sure your green
        screens are set up properly, track markers are efficiently placed, while
        gathering data and preventing problems that may arise so the post
        production pipeline runs smoothly.

        With this technique we remove any unintended productions tools from a
        scene (such as wires, harnesses, microphones) or unwanted environment
        scenery (logos, ads, vehicles, etc.) to keep the final image flawless.

        Through this technique we create a digital replicate of a real-life
        camera movement, allowing us to add computer-generated elements during
        further stages in post-production.
