        We specialize on **Rotoscoping,** the art of animating masks on a
        timeline, isolating any elements so they can be individually used in
        further post production processes.

        With this technique we remove any unintended productions tools from a
        scene (such as wires, harnesses, microphones) or unwanted environment
        scenery (logos, ads, vehicles, etc.) to keep the final image flawless.

        Using different techniques we create the illusion that an environment is
        larger than what was originally filmed, reducing on-set production costs
        and adding production value.

        Through this technique we create a digital replicate of a real-life

        further stages in post-production.
